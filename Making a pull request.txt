Steps to creating a branch, and making a pull reuest (PR):
-----------------------------------------------------
1. git checkout master ----> make sure you are on the master branch

2. git pull ----> pulls the most recent version of master so your new branch is up to date

3. git branch <branch name> ----> create a new branch with format Name/<current task> ex: Patrick/login-feature

4. git checkout <branch name> ----> checkout your newly created branch

5. *make changes*

6. git add . ----> stage all changes

7. git status ----> check current branch status

8. git commit -m "<commit description>" ----> commit changes to local branch

9. git push origin <branch name> ----> pushes changes to your remote branch to be merged into master

10. in github, make a pull request (branches > active branches > <branch name> > New pull request)

11. when done with branch (PR HAS BEEN MERGED INTO MASTER), delete it 
	- delete it locally using: git branch -d <branch name>
	- delete remote branch in github "branches" section
-----------------------------------------------------

*step 3 & 4 can be combined into a single command:
	git checkout -b <branch name>
this creates a new branch and switches to it

*if you wish to only stage some files (not all):
	git add <file name>
